### Intro

This is a Redis Cluster Controller to control the state of the cluster nodes and provide http api and tools(both command line and web ui).

It is production-ready and used at [baidu.com](http://www.baidu.com), with a scale of 1500+ machines.

The system should be used conbining with `https://github.com/ksarch-saas/redis` and `https://github.com/ksarch-saas/r3proxy`:

### Features

* Multi-IDC Support, every node has a tag, never elect node in a backup region as master.
* Replication via siblings, do partial resync from new master if it is our sibling.
* Builtin web console and command line tools for realtime monitor and control.
* Configurable read preferences, you can read from primary, primary_preferred or neareat region.
* Global failover constraint, if many many clusters deploy on the same machine pool, two clusters will never exec failover jobs at the same time.
* Slot rebalance.
* Cluster configuration convergence, topology of cluster maintained by redis cluster nodes
